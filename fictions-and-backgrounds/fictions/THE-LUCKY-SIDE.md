THE LUCKY SIDE
==============
by Daniel Lovat Clark

Dodger raced up the knife-edge of the crystal spur and ran himself right out of room. Behind, an angry mountain of scales, teeth, and hate—ahead a fall to certain death. So Dodger hurled himself out into Luck-knew- what, felt his hands catch on a rough tangle of razorwhip vines, and swung himself out and up as the crystal shattered behind him.

The toothy thing behind him let out a roar so loud that Dodger’d swear it gave his swing just the fling it needed to land him on the far side of the ravine. He teetered on that edge, saw the glimmering spears of the crystal canyon below, the grand sweep of the golden plains beyond, the shining swamp, the shadow of the Sanctum above, till he finally tottered off his teeter onto the Lucky side of things.

Safe. For a moment.

He took a deep breath and fiddled with his damn cloak. It was out of Æmber. No fading into the shadows for Dodger, not now anyhow. “Ah, it’s no fun when it’s easy anyway,” he muttered, glancing down into the ravine. The teeth with legs—too many legs—had scrambled down the cliff face and reared up, snuffling the sky with its scaly serpentine snout.

“What did you do, tiny?” Valdr’s voice boomed with laughter as she stepped to the edge of the cliff, watching the beast scrabble forward. Dodger looked up, and up, and up, two or three Dodgers high to where the Brobnar giant’s head was haloed by the sun far above.

He flashed his best grin, his getting-out-of-trouble grin, his teeth white in the shadows of his inky-dark face, like a flashing knife in the shadows proper.

“Well its spines are Æmber, ain’t they?” said Dodger, flicking one purple-black finger to where the crystalline spines piercing through its scales glowed with a blood-red light in the gloom of the ravine. “And herself needs Æmber, she said.”

“And you’ve brought it straight to us,” Valdr said as the thing began climbing the rock wall toward them, all scrabble and snarl. “How thoughtful.” She lifted her rocket-hammer and thumbed the catch, wak- ing the engine that grumble-mumbled within its massive steel head. She frowned as Dodger slipped behind her, all innocence, ma’am. “What is it, do you know?”

“Well, it’s a snufflegator, ain’t it,” said Dodger.

“So you don’t know,” Valdr replied. As the snufflegator streaked over the edge of the cliff, teeth-and-roar first, she brought her hammer down, a thunderbolt on its skull, bang! It twitched once, then lay still. “Gather that Æmber,” Valdr said, turning to go. “And you’re welcome.”

Dodger giggled and extended his wrist-knife as he crouched by the thing’s dead head. Maybe he could skim a little Æmber off the top, recharge his cloak, spare a little for his guild back home? The Archon would never miss it, would she, wouldn’t grudge Dodger a little taste

of the honey in the pot? He dug at the first spine, feeling it warm and singing beneath his touch. But before he could decide whether to slip it into a hidden pocket or not, she was there: Miss “Onyx” Censorius, the Archon herself, leaning over him, as curious and beautiful and impossi- ble as ever.

“Uh, hullo, m’lady,” Dodger managed, placing the Æmber spine on the ground next to him and starting on the next and never dreaming of taking a little of his own out, not faithful Dodger, no. “Plenty of good Æmber here. Should be more’n enough to forge you one of them keys you was asking for.”

“Yes,” she said. “But the material alone isn’t enough, Dodger. Courage is what makes this key.” She reached out one perfect finger to touch the broken beast’s broken snout. Dodger wondered what the others saw when they looked at her, at Onyx. To him, she was a vision, an elf like him but yet unlike, taller, radiant with light. Breath-taking, in the literal sense. She had some of the strength of Valdr’s Brobnar giants, too, powerful arms, broad shoulders...but the same dispassionate, terrible focus of the worst of the demons of Dis. When she looked at him, Dodger wasn’t certain if he was a bug on a pin in her collection, or her best earner, or her next meal.

He realized she was still talking. “And for Courage, we must first have Fear.” She stood, gathering up the last of Dodger’s Æmber spines, then tucked one into the inside pocket of his coat. “Be brave, Dodger. For me?” She smiled and Dodger nodded, dumbstruck.

“Brave about what?” he wondered, as the first of the snuf- flegator’s starving children squirmed free from its body, teeth-first...
