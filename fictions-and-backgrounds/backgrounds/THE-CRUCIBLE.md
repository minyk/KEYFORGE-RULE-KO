THE CRUCIBLE
============

“I got a pretty good look as the Quantum was breaking apart on approach. A massive planet, an unfinished shell above, and that world-piercing, impossible spire. And above even that, behind us—I think even from space, we may have been inside the thing.”
— Captain Val Jericho, United Stars Starship Quantum

“The Mintaran grub-ant has no concept that it is inside a terrarium, no awareness of the world outside. Some days, I wonder if I’m the grub-ant.”
— Quixo the “Adventurer”

The massive world at the heart of the universe. The melting-pot, where ten thousand times ten thousand worlds meld together, aliens and AIs and ancient societies thrust together in unexpected ways. They call it the Crucible.

No one knows when it was built, save to say “long, long ago.” No one knows who built it, except to say “the Architects.” And no one knows its purpose, unless it is truly only what it seems: a place to bring parts of every planet, every species, every culture in the galaxy together.

From the surface, it seems like any other planet. It has gravity (some- times more, sometimes less), an atmosphere (sometimes breathable, sometimes toxic). Plants, animals, mineral formations, ruins of civiliza- tions gone by—to walk on the Crucible is to explore not just one alien world, but all of them. From the floating cities of the Sanctum to the crystal forests of the Æmberwood, from the towering shoulders of Sleeping Giant Mountain to the quicksilver pools of Arygrum Bog, from the windswept red plains of Nova Hellas to the bottomless canyons of Echoing Deep, there is no end to the wonders the Crucible has to offer.

And the people! From a hundred thousand worlds and a hundred million cultures, all living shoulder-to-shoulder-to-tentacle across the Crucible. Whether in roving bands or quiet villages or bustling cities, towering fortresses or serene temples, merchants or brigands or kings or scientists, the people! With so many different species and cultures living side-by-side, the old nations and empires of the homeworlds are gone—mostly. The elves of the Shadows or the Brobnar tribes might still keep their own communities aloof, but they also walk the streets of the Crucible’s many cities, just like everyone else. The Martian Empire might be a bunch of conquering xenophobes, but their people still slip away to catch the latest Rolling Bugs concert just like everyone else. The innu- merable houses of the Crucible, many of them rose up on the Crucible itself, but even the ones that came from a homeworld, like the Shadows, now count aliens among their number. The Crucible changes everyone, given enough time.

If nothing else, it changes your perspective. Because above it all rises the Spire, that impossible tower that rises from the pole and climbs to space. And from the spire spreads, what? An unfinished layer of the Crucible? A mighty spaceport, reserved for the use of the Architects? Who can guess? But stare into the clear blue sky long enough, and you’ll swear you see the trusses and scaffolding of a world under con- struction. The Crucible, impossible and gigantic and artificial, and ever growing, ever evolving.

ARCHONS
=======

“To a shy lad from a tiny village, it was like an angel had come down to walk among us. I was right, in a way, and yet terribly, terribly wrong.”
— Commander Remiel, Knight of the Sanctum

“You look at us and think: you are as unto a god, but we look at you and think: this marvelous being is something I can never truly understand. We are all here to learn from one another, whether in peace or in conflict. That must be the Crucible’s purpose.”
— Miss “Onyx” Censorius, Archon

Life on the Crucible came from elsewhere. This is widely understood, widely acknowledged. Disparate worlds, mashed together and nudged along by the robotic fairies that most assume are creations of the Architects, all kept in some sort of balance. Then what is unique to the Crucible?

The answer seems to be the archons. Child gods, or manifestations of a central AI, or transcended mortals, or beings of pure energy. No one knows. The archons themselves don’t know or won’t tell. But they travel across the Crucible, studying the people and animals they find, always eager to learn more about their surroundings.

The archons are strange beings, difficult for mere mortals to under- stand. They have bodies only when they choose to, existing at other times as a disembodied consciousness or glowing energy being.

The only trait that they all seem to share is their ability to speak to all sentient beings. Otherwise, they are as diverse in appearance and char- acter as the Crucible itself.

Archons commonly seek out companions for their journeys, and they are always on the lookout for the mysterious vaults of the Crucible, secret caches of wisdom, power, or understanding that only the archons can access. To open a vault, archons must contest with one another in a race to gather the necessary æmber and forge the keys the vault requires. This contest has elements of a sacred ritual, a sporting event, and a bareknuckle back-alley brawl, all mixed together. The exchanges almost inevitably turn violent, but deaths are rare. In fact, thanks to the advanced technology and unusual abilities available to archons, most such contests are advantageous to their followers. When the archons successfully open a vault, they find within a treasure trove of wisdom, technology, and some undefinable energy that the archons absorb directly. Aside from this unique energy, the spoils of the vault are com- monly shared with the archon’s followers—a powerful incentive to join an archon’s company.

For some, the promise of such treasure is reason enough to follow an archon into danger, but others have nobler intentions. Traveling with an archon is always exciting, a never-ending cavalcade of the unexpect- ed. On the Crucible, “exciting” is often synonymous with “deadly,” but archons can possess powers and abilities to keep their followers (rela- tively) safe, from healing powers to the gift of foresight. If nothing else, the archon’s gift of tongues can let their followers meet peaceably with other tribes and nations with whom they would otherwise have no way to communicate. Archons of a more warlike bent may attract followers who wish to keep their communities safe, or who relish the chance to lash out against enemies known and unknown. There’s always someone willing to risk everything in service to such a powerful and enigmatic being.

And when the archons open enough vaults and move on, to wherever it is archons go, their followers are usually left better off for the experi- ence. And only rarely suddenly abandoned deep in a hostile part of the Crucible where they will surely meet their doom.

KEYS
====

I helped Miss Onyx forge her third key. It...did not go the way I thought. I knew it would be made of æmber, that much I got right, but I thought we would place it on my forge, strike a few blows with the hammer, get the shape of the stuff just so, and that would be that. But her ladyship couldn’t have been less interested in what it looked like.

She took the æmber, still glowing-hot, from my tongs. “This will do,” she said. “Now, we must teach this key to experience joy. What brings you joy, Valdr?”

I thought about that for a minute. “Those fluff pastries Dodger found in the last village,” I said.

“Those were delicious,” Miss Onyx agreed. “Let’s see if Dodger has any left.""
